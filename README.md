# Minecraft Modded Server

## Setup instructions
1. Download Java 17 and install it: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads
   - Windows: Select the "Java 17" tab, then "Windows", then "x64 Installer"
   - Mac: Select the "Java 17" tab, then "Mac", then "x64 DMG Installer"
2. Download MultiMC and install it:
   - Windows: https://files.multimc.org/downloads/mmc-stable-win32.zip
   - Mac: https://files.multimc.org/downloads/mmc-stable-osx64.tar.gz
3. Open MultiMC
4. Select language of your choosing
5. Select Java 17 from the list (you might see two, both should work) and set minimum memory allocation to 1024 MiB, maximum to 2048 MiB
8. Uncheck "Enable Analytics"
9. Add Instance --> Import from zip --> Enter "https://danny6514.github.io/1.20.1-modded.zip" --> Click "OK"
10. Double click on 1.20.1-modded
11. If this is the first time starting, it will prompt you to log in to your microsoft/mojang account, please do that, and close the settings window when done.
12. Minecraft should download then open --> Click "Multiplayer" --> "Add Server" --> Server address: 140.238.147.131 --> "Done"
13. Double click the newly added server, and it should connect.

Going forward, all you need to do is open MultiMC and click "1.20.1-modded" (step 13) to play.

## Shaders

This modpack comes with [Complementary Shader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders), it is disabled by default as it is GPU-hungry. For those with a more powerful GPU, turning it on will significantly improve the graphics. To enable: Press ESC in game --> Options --> Video Settings --> Shader Packs --> Select "ComplementaryShaders_vx.x.zip" then click "Done"

Feel free to also browse around for other shaders, as long as it is compatible with game version 1.20.1 and Iris (mod we are using in lieu of Optifine, as Optifine is bug-prone).

## Resource Packs

This modpack comes with two resource packs: [Faithful 64x](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/faithful-64x) and [Better Leaves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/motschens-better-leaves). Again, feel free to replace as you see fit: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A9008&filter-sort=4
