## Shaders

This modpack comes with custom shaders, it is disabled by default as it is GPU-hungry. For those with a more powerful GPU, turning it on will significantly improve the graphics. To enable: Press ESC in game --> Options --> Video Settings --> Shader Packs --> Select "Complementary**.zip" then click "Done"
