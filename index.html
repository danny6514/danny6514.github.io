      <h2>Software Engineer 3</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Full Stack Developer for SAP Jam, an enterprise social networking application with emphasize on collaboration.</li>
        <li>Worked in a team of 4 developers to bring the most well-received UI revamp in SAP Jam’s history with no major functional regressions in 10 weeks. This led to an employee recognition award.</li>
        <li>Led the UX Overhaul effort for SAP Jam’s forum pages, with parts of the work shown during SAP’s annual developer conference in March 2014.</li>
        <li>Strong ability to learn and perform as demonstrated by leading the entire SAP Jam engineering team with 368 checkins within the first 6 months of employment without sacrificing code quality. This resulted in a year-end promotion and an “outstanding” on the performance review.</li>
        <li>Developed draft and auto-save capabilities for SAP Jam text editors, greatly enhancing usability while reducing the occurrences of data loss when editing contents such as wiki pages or blogs.</li>

        <li>Developed and designed an application that dynamically manages perforce client specs and workspace files based on the user's roles and projects. This reduced overhead time by as much as 90% since repetitive tasks such as client spec modifications, disk space checking, and file syncing are now done automatically.</li>

      <div>
        <span>This ASP.NET MVC 4 project creates a long term monitoring system that continuously monitors the frequency, pattern and severity of a patient’s tremors in the legs. This project would allow doctors to monitor the tremors of a patient by measuring their leg movements, such as acceleration, speed and orientation. The doctor can use the measured data to provide better diagnostics and treatments for Parkinson's disease patients.</span>
